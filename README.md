Don't know if this is the best way, but it gets Win-working versions of various useful libraries installed:

Found on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54734667/error-installing-geopandas-a-gdal-api-version-must-be-specified-in-anaconda) and extended to include everything else needed.

## GPX Files

* `<trk>` is track. Within that,
* `<trkseg>` is a track segment. I'm guessing there may be more than one of these, although my files look to have one. Within that, I'm seeing lots of
* `<trkpt>` with attributes "lat" and "lon" and contents of `<ele>` (elevation) and `<time>` stamps. No distance (or velocity) information, so something to calculate the distance between two `<trkpt>`s is going to be needed

## Distance Calculation

The Haversine formula:

See: http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html

a = sin²(Δφ/2) + cos φ1 ⋅ cos φ2 ⋅ sin²(Δλ/2)
c = 2 ⋅ atan2( √a, √(1−a) )
d = R ⋅ c
where φ is latitude, λ is longitude, R is earth's radius (mean radius = 6,371km); note that angles need to be in radians to pass to trig functions!

JavaScript:
```
const R = 6371e3; // metres
const φ1 = lat1 * Math.PI/180; // φ, λ in radians
const φ2 = lat2 * Math.PI/180;
const Δφ = (lat2-lat1) * Math.PI/180;
const Δλ = (lon2-lon1) * Math.PI/180;

const a = Math.sin(Δφ/2) * Math.sin(Δφ/2) +
          Math.cos(φ1) * Math.cos(φ2) *
          Math.sin(Δλ/2) * Math.sin(Δλ/2);
const c = 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(1-a));

const d = R * c; // in metres
```
